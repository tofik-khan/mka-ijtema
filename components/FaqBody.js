            The Ijtema officially begins on August 19<sup>th</sup> with the
            Jummah Prayers. The Jummah Prayer will begin at 1:00pm. The
            activities for Ijtema will begin at 11:00am so the Admin team is

            * Please note that if you are part of the MKA Shura, the Shura

          <h3 className="text-italic pt-3">What airports can I arrive at?</h3>
          <p>
            BWI Airport is the closest airport to the Baitur Rahman Mosque. The
            distance from BWI airport to BRM is around 26 miles by car. Members
            of the transport team will be available at BWI, DCA & IAD airports.
            <strong> However, BWI is preferred due to proximity.</strong> For
            any further information please contact to Ansar Malik Sahib (240)
            491-7750.

            budget. If you need help covering your travel costs, please reach
