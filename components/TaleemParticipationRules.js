              These individual competitions required qualification at regional

              As not all regions held a regional Ijtema or missed to hold some
              of these competitions, on the first day of Ijtema (Friday 8/19),
              it will be possible for Khuddam from these regions to participate
              in a qualifying round for these competitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Khuddam who missed the Ijtema for other genuine reason can also
              participate in this with the permission of their Qaid, e.g. missed
              ijtema because you needed to participate in Virtual Waqf-e-Nau
              Mulaqat. If you missed regional Ijtema because of work and/or
              studies, this does not count as a valid excuse to participate in
              this qualifying round.

              Team members stand in a row. A message is orally conveyed by the
              competition organizers to the first team member. He passes on the
              message to the second team member without the other team members
              hearing it. This continues until the message reaches the last team
              member, who shares the message to the competition organizers.
